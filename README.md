# Movie-Review-Sentiment-Analysis
Movie Review Sentiment Analysis using NLTK VADER

## About DataSet
The 2,000 record IMDb movie review database is accessible through NLTK directly with

from nltk.corpus import movie_reviews However, since we already have it in a tab-delimited file we'll use that instead.

## What does it do?
This project is mainly about to show how the VADER Sentiment Analyzer works on the data. More focus is on the working process not on the accuracy as there is no Machine learning model we trained in this project. We have build a pipeline to vectorize the date, then train and fit a model.

## Keep Learning!
